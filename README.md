- 👋 Hi, I’m @H4N5-antw
- 👀 Interested in walking, cycling and exploring both rural and urban areas, adding anything that's obviously missing in OpenStreetMap and used to upload time-lapse photo sequences to Mapillary (ended late spring 2021)
- 🌱 Currently learning (perhaps a tad embarrassing?) : how to cut&paste on an Android 10 smartphone. 
- 💞️ Contributing to OpenStreetMap and Mapillary (before the browser-based uploader was discontinued), looking to provide feedback on Vespucci, Mapillary and perhaps Osmand from the viewpoint of an OSM contributor. 
- 📫 How to reach me : haven't worked that out yet, use the same user name on OSM (where you can mail me), and -without the hyphen- on Mapillary (where there are no PMs) ; might be that you could send me a message here in Github which will eventually end up in the inbox?
